Apply existing taxonomies to your BuddyPress Docs library.

== Description ==

Apply existing taxonomies to your BuddyPress Docs library.

= Features =
* Allow your users to apply taxonomy terms from taxonomies of your choosing to docs they create.
* Add filter links based on these terms to the BP Docs library header.

= Requirements =
This plugin builds on BuddyPress Docs, which must be installed and activated for this plugin to work. This plugin works with existing taxonomies only; if you want to add a custom taxonomy, you'll need a tool to do that. [Custom Post Type UI](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/) performs that task well and is well-maintained.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin via the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin via the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Visit the Docs > Taxonomies screen to choose which additional taxonomies you would like to use with BuddyPress Docs.


== Screenshots ==

1. Filter your Docs library by terms in the additional taxonomies of your choice.
2. Choose terms on the edit and create screens.


== Changelog ==

= 1.0 =
* First version.
